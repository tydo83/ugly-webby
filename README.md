# Ugly Webby

For our first CSS project, we are NOT going to make something beautiful. In fact, the opposite; we're going to be taking a reasonable-looking (if not beautiful) site and making it as unreasonable-looking as possible.

Welcome to Ugly Webby!

Fork this repo, then check out `style.css`. Play with the values, add new property-value combinations (maybe play with the `background-color` property?), add CSS rules for other selectors (`h3` for example doesn't have any rules for it yet!), and just generally mess stuff _up_.

Don't change the html _at all_, but `style.css` is your personal playground.

Or more like your tower of blocks to knock over. Your walls to crayon across.

We look forward to seeing what ugly phoenix rises from this repo's ashes. Good luck!


### Workflow

* This is a `fork`-and-`clone` situation.
* Do NOT change the HTML!


### Hints

* Adding ugly photos is obviously fun, but not particularly creative. Think of something weird you could do to the content that's already there!
* If your css isn't applying, check:
    * that your selector is working... try making the background color black or the text color red so that you know that some basic, easily visible rule is applying. If not, then you're not targeting the visual element correctly!
    * that your property name isn't wrong--if you're able to change _something_ about the visual element, then the issue is in what you're trying to change.
